### Description

MyDissertation.pdf contains the dissertation itself. Defense.pdf contains the slides that I used for my presentation to my PhD committee. Here follows a (very rough) description of the contents of my dissertation. Please read the dissertation itself for more rigorous details.

The results of my dissertation belong to the branch of algebra known as combinatorial representation theory. In my dissertation I study the Oriented Brauer Category by studying its locally finite dimensional representations, ie. how it acts on certain naturally occurring objects called representations (or modules). These representations are typically infinite dimensional, but can be decomposed in a canonical way as a direct sum of finite dimensional pieces. The Oriented Brauer Category is defined combinatorially. That is, it has a basis consisting of certain diagrams. These diagrams are formed by drawing two horizontal rows of vertices, one lying above the other, and connecting these vertices with "strings". By stacking such diagrams we define a multiplication, as thus an algebraic structure.

The main results of my dissertation include a classification of the simple modules, which should be thought of as the atomic building blocks of all locally finite dimensional modules. I then prove that the locally finite dimensional modules of the Oriented Brauer Category admit a categorical action, which mimicks the action of a well-known Lie algebra. This categorical action has some special properties which make it an example of a generalization of some notions introduced to the literature in recent years by Ivan Losev and Ben Webster. See the dissertation for details.

In process of proving the above results, I define some combinatorial gadgets, called the branching graph and the crystal graph, which are useful for computing certain aspects of the aforementioned modules, such as dimension and composition multiplicities. I rely on the results of Nick Davidson (another PhD student of Brundan) to prove that the crystal graph does what I claim in the dissertation.
